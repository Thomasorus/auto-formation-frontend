# Auto formation on frontend tech

I have experience with multiple frontend libraries and frameworks, but with the rapid updates they get I can fall behind quickly. Which is why this repo exist: each branch is almost the same project made in a different tech, with the purpose of learning.

## Projects goals

Each project should:
- Have multiple pages, nested, to check how routing works.
- Have several components, nested, with props and how to pass between them, also event forwarding/two-way data-binding.
- Consume API endpoints and show its data to the user (see fetching strategies for each lib/framework).
- Change the data (computed values through multiple data sources) and the data should stay reactive (use stores).
- Contain a complex multi-step form to see how forms are handled (nested arrays of reactive values and changes to them)
- Transition/animations of pages
- Use lifeCycle methods (on mount, after mount, after change, etc)
- Auth: setting cookies, tokens, refreshing them, etc.


## Backend

The backend is provided locally by [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/). Use `./pocketbase` to launch it.
